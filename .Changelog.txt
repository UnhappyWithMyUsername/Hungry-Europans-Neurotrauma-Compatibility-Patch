- Made glass fragments more NT friendly by applying foreign body and internal bleeding when consumed instead of vanilla organ damage
- Fixed cooked/roasted/burned organs not being properly edible
- Fixed surgery table not allowing you to sleep
- Fixed adrenaline not getting you back on your feet | NT disables this somehow so for now it just applies more health to your character to combat this until I figure out a proper solution
